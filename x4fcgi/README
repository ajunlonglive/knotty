This project is for xic service provided by fcgi program.

x4fcgi is a daemon translate xic protocol to fcgi protocol.

xic client connects and quests to the x4fcgi like a normal xic server,
The x4fcgi sends the quests to the fcgi program and return the answer
from the fcgi program to the client.

The x4fcgi server must set environment variable XIC4FCGI_VERSION to 1.
The fcgi program must return a header "XIC4FCGI_VERSION: 1".

The stdin for the fcgi program is xic quest message body itself, which
means it's vbs encoded. The content (wiping off the headers) of the 
stdout from the fcgi program is xic answer message body.

The fcgi program can be written by any program language, but a dynamic
language such as PHP is more common.

The x4fcgi does not define any xic interface and method, because all
it does is a translation instead of the bussiness logics.
